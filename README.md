# 🤖 AI From Zero to Expert

This repository documents my complete learning journey in Artificial Intelligence, starting from absolute zero knowledge and progressing step-by-step to advanced AI concepts and practical expertise.

The goal of this repo is not memorization or buzzwords, but deep conceptual understanding, strong intuition, and real-world applicability — explained in simple language using analogies, mental models, and hands-on examples.

## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists

Most AI resources jump straight into:
- Heavy math
- Complex code
- Unexplained jargon

This repository is different.

I am learning AI using a first-principles approach, focusing on:
- Why a concept exists
- How it works internally
- Where it is used in the real world
- How to think like an AI practitioner, not just use tools

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Inside

This repo is organized like a learning brain, where each layer builds on the previous one.
